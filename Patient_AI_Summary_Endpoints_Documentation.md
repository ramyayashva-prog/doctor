# Patient AI Summary Endpoints Documentation

This document provides comprehensive input/output documentation for the Patient AI Summary endpoints, including setup requirements and usage examples.

## üìã Overview

The Patient AI Summary system uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to analyze comprehensive patient data and generate professional medical summaries for doctors. The system aggregates data from multiple sources including symptoms, medications, nutrition, mental health logs, and appointments.

## üîß Prerequisites

### OpenAI API Key Setup
Before using the AI summary endpoints, you must configure the OpenAI API key:

1. **Get OpenAI API Key:**
   - Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

2. **Configure Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file or environment variables
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Restart the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   python app_mvc.py
   ```

## ü§ñ AI Analysis Process

### 1. Data Collection
The system automatically retrieves comprehensive patient data from the database, including:
- Patient profile information
- All health data entries across categories
- Summary statistics and counts

### 2. Data Formatting
Patient data is formatted into a structured report for AI analysis:
```
PATIENT SUMMARY REPORT
=====================

PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Name: John Doe
- Email: john.doe@example.com
- Age: 28
- Blood Type: O+
- Gender: Male
- Pregnant: No
- Status: Active
- Date of Birth: 1995-03-15
- Mobile: +1234567890
- Address: 123 Main St, City, State
- Emergency Contact: Jane Doe (+0987654321)

HEALTH DATA SUMMARY:
- Total Appointments: 1
- Food & Nutrition Entries: 3
- Symptom Analysis Reports: 1
- Mental Health Logs: 1
- Medication History: 1
- Kick Count Logs: 0
- Prescription Documents: 0
- Vital Signs Logs: 0

DETAILED HEALTH INFORMATION:
[Detailed data from each category...]
```

### 3. AI Processing
The formatted data is sent to OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo with a medical analysis prompt:

**AI Prompt Structure:**
```
Please analyze the following patient data and provide a comprehensive medical summary. Focus on:

1. Patient Overview (demographics, pregnancy status, general health indicators)
2. Health Data Analysis (patterns in symptoms, nutrition, mental health)
3. Key Concerns or Recommendations
4. Overall Health Assessment
5. Priority Areas for Medical Attention

Patient Data:
[Formatted patient data]

Please provide a clear, professional medical summary suitable for a doctor's review.
```

### 4. Response Generation
The AI generates a structured medical summary covering:
- **Patient Overview** - Demographics and general status
- **Health Data Analysis** - Patterns and trends in health data
- **Key Concerns** - Important medical observations
- **Recommendations** - Suggested actions or follow-ups
- **Priority Areas** - Areas requiring medical attention

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "OpenAI API key not found"
**Solution:** Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here` to your `.env` file and restart the server.

#### 2. "Failed to generate AI summary"
**Possible Causes:**
- OpenAI API key invalid or expired
- OpenAI API quota exceeded
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid patient data

#### 3. "Patient not found"
**Solution:** Verify the patient ID exists in the database.

#### 4. "Unauthorized access"
**Solution:** Ensure you're sending a valid Bearer token in the Authorization header.

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Server Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Look for OpenAI API errors
   tail -f server.log | grep -i openai
   ```

2. **Verify API Key:**
   ```bash
   # Test OpenAI API key directly
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
        https://api.openai.com/v1/models
   ```

3. **Test Patient Data:**
   ```bash
   # Verify patient exists and has data
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/doctor/patient/PATIENT_ID/full-details" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

## üí° Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Cache AI Summaries** - Avoid regenerating summaries for unchanged data
2. **Error Handling** - Always check the `success` field before using `ai_summary`
3. **Rate Limiting** - Implement client-side rate limiting for AI requests
4. **Fallback** - Provide fallback summaries when AI is unavailable

### For Medical Professionals
1. **Review AI Output** - Always review AI-generated summaries before making medical decisions
2. **Data Freshness** - Ensure patient data is up-to-date before generating summaries
3. **Comprehensive Analysis** - Use AI summaries as a starting point, not final diagnosis
4. **Documentation** - Keep records of AI-generated insights for future reference

---

## üìû Support

For technical issues:
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify OpenAI API key configuration
3. Test with different patient IDs
4. Ensure network connectivity to OpenAI API

For medical concerns:
- AI summaries are for informational purposes only
- Always consult with qualified medical professionals
- Do not rely solely on AI-generated medical advice
